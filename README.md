The goal of mSigHdp is to do mutational signature extraction using hdp
(Hierarchical Dirichlet Process).

## Installation

Install the development version of mSigHdp from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with the R command line:

``` r
# To install from a private repo, use auth_token with a token
# from https://github.com/settings/tokens. You only need the
# repo scope. Best practice is to save your PAT in env var called
# GITHUB_PAT.
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("steverozen/mSigHdp", auth_token = "abc")
```
