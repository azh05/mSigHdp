\usage{
PlotExposure(exposures, plot.proportion = FALSE, plot.legend = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{exposures}{Exposures as a numerical matrix (or data.frame) with
signatures in rows and samples in columns. Rownames are taken
as the signature names and column names are taken as the
sample IDs. If you want \code{exp} sorted from largest to smallest
use \code{\link{SortExp}}. Do not use column names that start
with multiple underscores. The exposures will often be mutation
counts, but could also be e.g. mutations per megabase.}

\item{plot.proportion}{Plot exposure proportions rather than counts.}

\item{plot.legend}{If \code{TRUE} plot a legend.}

\item{...}{Parameters passed to \code{\link[graphics]{barplot}}.}
